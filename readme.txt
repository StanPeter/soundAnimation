Information:

A small sound animation project using Paper.js library and Howler.js library

By pressing any key from data.js (basically from "a" to "z") will show a random color Circle animation
which will scale until it dissappear + will produce a sound bounded to that key

Data(or better said variables) are inside data.js and JS logic inside index.html


Instruction:

    1. Open index.html in your browser(chrome preferred)
    2. Press any key from A - Z in order to see sound animation




Error handling ?:

PS: There will be Cross Origin error in the console which you can simply ignore or 
    get rid of by running a local HTTP server
    --> for example with python3(+ I use ubuntu so Windows might differ) in terminal 
    
    " python -m http.server "

    This will create " http://localhost:8000 " local server
