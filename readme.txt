A small sound animation project using Paper.js library and Howler.js library

By pressing any key from data.js (basically from "a" to "z") will show a random color Circle animation
which will scale until it dissappear + will produce a sound bounded to that key

I tried to put all JS code to another file but could not sort out an error

Also there will be Cross Origin error in the console which you can get rid
of by running a local HTTP server
--> for example on python3 in terminal " python -m http.server "
which will open " http://localhost:8000 " local server


Whoever can use these codes however he wishes
